Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation

Sample Case 0: 
 is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: 
 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution
{
    public static void main(String[]aa)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if(n%2!=0)
        {

{
    public static void main(String[]aa)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if(n%2!=0)
        {
            System.out.println("Weird");
        }
        else if(n%2==0)
        {
            if(n>=2 && n<=5)
            {
                System.out.println("Not Weird");
            }
            else if(n>=6 && n<=20)
            {
                System.out.println("Weird");
            }
            else if(n>=20)
